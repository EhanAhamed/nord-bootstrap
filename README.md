![NordTheme Bootstrap](.github/screenshots/banner.png)
# Bootstrap's CSS, modified to use the Nord color scheme!

What's Bootstrap? Visit [their website](https://getbootstrap.com/) for information and documentation about Bootstrap!

This is not a fork of Bootstrap, but rather a modified version of one specific part of bootstrap; it's CSS styles.

This is not a pull request or rejected contribution to Bootstrap, this is Bootstrap's CSS but modified to fit the "Nord" color scheme!

This is made to be used by developers that are creating responsive websites or webapps in the Nord color scheme. If you are trying to make a responsive website or webapp that does not use the Nord color scheme, then use the original [Bootstrap](https://getbootstrap.com/), not this recolored version of it!
