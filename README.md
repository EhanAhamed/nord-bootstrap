## How To Use
First, download the CSS file found in this repo. Use the minified version; `nordbootstrap.min.css`, for any use other than debugging the CSS. (for debugging the css, use the pretty print file inclided in this repo; `nordbootstrap.css`)

Next, link the downloaded css file to the `<head> </head>` html of your webpage, link it before any other css files you may use.

Then, follow [bootstrap's documentation](https://getbootstrap.com/docs/5.1/getting-started/javascript/) on how to link their optional javascript files (these javascript libraries add extra functionality to your webpage, and are not required for your website to function properly)

And, you're done! It's as simple as that! ðŸ˜¸
