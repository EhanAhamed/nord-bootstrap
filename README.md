# NordTheme Bootstrap
This is Bootstrap's CSS, modified to use the Nord color scheme!

What's Bootstrap? Visit [their website](https://getbootstrap.com/) for information and documentation about Bootstrap!

This is not a fork of Bootstrap, but rather a modified version of one specific part of bootstrap; it's CSS styles.

This is not a pull request or rejected contribution to Bootstrap, this is Bootstrap's CSS but modified to fit the "Nord" color scheme!

This is made to be used by developers that are creating responsive websites or webapps in the Nord color scheme. If you are trying to make a responsive website or webapp that does not use the Nord color scheme, then use the original [Bootstrap](https://getbootstrap.com/), not this recolored version of it!

## How To Use
First, download the CSS file found in this repo. Use the minified version; [`nordbootstrap.min.css`](./nordbootstrap.min.css), for any use other than debugging the CSS. (for debugging the css, use the pretty print file inclided in this repo; [`nordbootstrap.css`](./nordbootstrap.css))

ðŸ‘‰ By the way, you can easily download individual files from the [releases tab](https://github.com/SaberTooth-Studios/NordTheme-Bootstrap/releases)

Next, link the downloaded css file to the `<head> </head>` html of your webpage, link it before any other css files you may use.

Then, follow [bootstrap's documentation](https://getbootstrap.com/docs/5.1/getting-started/javascript/) on how to link their optional javascript files (these javascript libraries add extra functionality to your webpage, and are not required for your website to function properly)

And, you're done! It's as simple as that! ðŸ˜¸
