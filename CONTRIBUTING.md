# How To Contribute

If you've found a problem then first open an issue!

Even if you're going to fix the issue yourself, still open an issue so that others will know you're already working on it and can help you with any challenges you might face!

If you open an issue and aren't gonna try and fix it, then no worries ðŸ˜… Me or someone else can fix it for you!

## Step By Step Instructions

First, Download the SCSS Variables file from this repo; [`nordbootstrap_variables.scss`](./nordbootstrap_variables.scss)

Next, open the file in an editor of your choice, I highly reccomend [bootstrap.build](https://bootstrap.build/), since it has a live preview of almost every element, and has great visual tools. 

Then, after you finish editing, if you used bootstrap.build to modify the file, export it from bootstrap.build as `_variables.scss`, `bootstrap.css`, and `bootstrap.min.css` files from the "export" dropdown at the top bar of the editor. If you used an exernal editor to edit the SCSS Variables file then import the modified SCSS Variables file into bootstrap.build and follow the steps above to generate the CSS files.

After that, open a pull request to this repo with your edits, and you're done! ðŸ¥³

### Thanks & Cya Later!
