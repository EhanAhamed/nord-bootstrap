# How To Contribute

If you've found a problem then first open an issue!

Even if you're going to fix the issue yourself, still open an issue so that others will know you're already working on it and can help you with any challenges you might face!

If you open an issue and aren't gonna try and fix it, then no worries ðŸ˜… Me or someone else can fix it for you!

## Step By Step Instructions

THIS SECTION WILL BE REWRITTEN AFTER MIGRATION TO BOOTSTRAP V5

After that, open a pull request to this repo with your edits, and you're done! ðŸ¥³

### Thanks & Cya Later!
